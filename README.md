    We are thankful to Masai team for developing such a great platform for learning we development from scratch.
  We we're working on cloning of an E-commerce website named as firefoxbikes.com. 
  We are developing this because of the things that we learnt in unit-2 of Masai curriculum.
In this website we can try to clone landing page and user-flow functionalities.
Furst user is opeining on landing page. After that user login to website , if not have to sign up. We are adding forgot password functionality also.
Then user is moving to bike section to buy it, select the product to buy. on clicking buy now the product will be added in cart.
By clicking on cart page user have to applied coupon code ike "MASAI50".
By applying code amount will be reduced to 50%. Once use the coupon code not applied agaain.
Now user moved from checkout to shipping page where user have to enter address details. 
After successfully entering address you have to enter correct card details. We can take sample as card number "123456789" cvv "123". 
After that redirect to OTP page where we take sample as "1234". Now your order is successfully placed. Now you can redirect to home page again.
